WebInsight is a Spring Boot-based web application that extracts and summarizes content from websites using a web crawler built with Jsoup.
The app allows users to input a website link, and it fetches, cleans, and extracts meaningful text from the webpage.
The extracted content is then processed and summarized using the Gemini API to provide a concise, informative summary.

âœ… Optimized for Wikipedia

Efficiently targets Wikipedia pages using #mw-content-text to extract only the main article content.

Handles disambiguation and other non-article pages gracefully.

âœ… Web Crawling

Uses Jsoup to scrape website content.

Targets specific HTML elements to extract clean and relevant text.

âœ… Content Processing

Cleans and trims the extracted content to remove unnecessary elements.

âœ… AI-Based Summarization

Sends extracted content to the Gemini API using WebClient.

The Gemini API returns a structured summary of the content.

âœ… Asynchronous Execution

Uses Reactor (Mono/Flux) for non-blocking execution to improve performance.

âœ… Structured Output

Returns a PageSummary object containing the webpage title and the summarized content.

Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ Add Selenium and Chrome WebDriver to handle websites with dynamic content (like JavaScript-heavy pages).
ðŸš€ Improve extraction logic to support a wider range of websites beyond Wikipedia.
ðŸš€ Enhance AI prompts to provide more accurate and structured summaries.
